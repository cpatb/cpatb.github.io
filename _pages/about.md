I am a first-year Physics PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://physics.northwestern.edu/) with interests in how we use the tools of statistical physics to better understand large, interacting systems, particularly those in the brain. Before Northwestern, I spent a few years working under [Dr. Paul Territo](https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/6529/territo-paul) at the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute in the Indiana University School of Medicine. Earlier, I studied physics and neuroscience at Earlham College.
