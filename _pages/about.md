I am a Physics PhD at [Northwestern University](https://physics.northwestern.edu/) and am working with [Dr. Istvan Kovacs](https://sites.northwestern.edu/kovacslab/) on understanding the relationships of structure and function in networks, with a focus on neural networks. Before Northwestern, I spent a few years working under [Dr. Paul Territo](https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/6529/territo-paul) at the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute in the Indiana University School of Medicine. Earlier, I studied physics and neuroscience at Earlham College.
