I am a second-year Physics PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://physics.northwestern.edu/) with interests in shear-thickening phenomena and soft condensed matter working under [Prof. Michelle Driscoll](https://driscollphysicslab.org). Before Northwestern, I spent a few years working under [Dr. Paul Territo](https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/6529/territo-paul) at the Stark Neurosciences Research Institute in the Indiana University School of Medicine. Earlier, I studied physics and neuroscience at Earlham College.
